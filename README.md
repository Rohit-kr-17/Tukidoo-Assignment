I have used ReactJS along with Tailwind CSS for styling to complete this assignment.
I have used flexbox to construct the layout
The icons used in this assignment are imported from react-icons library.
I have used the react-player module to integrate the video player in this assignment.
I have done this under the assumption that this assignment is to test my designing approach and hence i have used different yet contextually similar icons that were easily available instead of what was there in the image provided
